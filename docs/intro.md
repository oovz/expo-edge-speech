# Getting Started with expo-edge-speech

**expo-edge-speech** is a text-to-speech library for Expo and React Native applications that provides high-quality voice synthesis using Microsoft's Edge TTS service. It offers a drop-in replacement for expo-speech with enhanced features including 400+ natural voices, better voice quality, word boundary events, and cross-platform support for both iOS and Android.

## Features

- **Drop-in replacement** for expo-speech with identical API
- **Enhanced voice quality** through Microsoft Edge TTS service
- **400+ natural voices** with multilingual support
- **Cross-platform pause/resume** support (including Android)
- **Word boundary events** for real-time text highlighting
- **Advanced configuration** for performance optimization
- **Comprehensive error handling** and recovery mechanisms

## Installation

### For Expo Projects

```bash
npm install expo-edge-speech
```

### For React Native Projects

React Native projects need Expo to use this library (and its dependencies):

```bash
# Install Expo (if not already installed)
npm install expo@sdk-52

# Install the library
npm install expo-edge-speech
```

### Requirements

- **Expo SDK 52** or higher
- **iOS 15.1+** / **Android API 24+**
- **React Native 0.76.9+**

## Quick Start

```typescript
import * as Speech from 'expo-edge-speech';

// Basic text-to-speech
await Speech.speak('Hello world');

// With options
await Speech.speak('Welcome to my app!', {
  voice: 'en-US-AriaNeural',
  rate: 1.2,
  onDone: () => console.log('Speech completed')
});
```
